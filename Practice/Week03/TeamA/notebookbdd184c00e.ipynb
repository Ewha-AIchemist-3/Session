A problem in which we are required to predict a value is known as a supervised problem. For example, if the problem is to predict house prices given historical house prices, with features like presence of a hospital, school or supermarket, distance to nearest public transport, etc. is a upervised problem. Similarly, when we are provided with images of cats and dogs, and we know beforehand which ones are cats and which ones are dogs, and if the task is to create a model which predicts whether a provided image is of a cat or a dog, the problem is considered to be \nsupervised.\n\nHere in this Dataset we have a Supervised Machine Learning Problem, For Heart Failure Prediction","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing all the libraries needed","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport warnings\nimport seaborn as sns\n#데이터를 시각화 하기 위해 matplotlib- 데이터 분석과 그래프\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n#인터랙티브한 그래프 위해 소환...\nimport plotly.express as px\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\npd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\",None)\n#데이터 전처리 과정\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nimport matplotlib \nmatplotlib.style.use('ggplot')\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-13T06:24:51.202064Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-13T06:24:51.202723Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-13T06:24:53.617972Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-13T06:24:51.202619Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-13T06:24:53.617111Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Context \n\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/8cBhJBU2wlq6H6qY4W/giphy.gif\">\n\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.

So when we get the dataset then we need to understand that the remaining 80% of data is still useful, so rather than dropping these values we need to somehow substitute the missing 20% values. We can do this with the help of Imputation.\n\n### Imputation:\n\nImputation is simply the process of substituting the missing values of our dataset. We can do this by defining our own customised function or we can simply perform imputation by using the SimpleImputer class provided by sklearn.\n\nFor example : \n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n\nimputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')\nimputer = imputer.fit(df[['Weight']])\ndf['Weight'] = imputer.transform(df[['Weight']])\n\n```\n\n### As we do not have any missing data so we will not be using this approch","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. Feature Scaling\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Why Should we Use Feature Scaling?\n\nThe first question we need to address – why do we need to scale the variables in our dataset? Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to feature scaling while others are virtually invariant to it. Let me explain that in more detail.\n\n## 1. Distance Based Algorithms : \n    \nDistance algorithms like **\"KNN\"**, **\"K-means\"** and **\"SVM\"** are most affected by the range of features. This is because behind the scenes they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity.\nWhem two features have different scales, there is a chance that higher weightage is given to features with higher magnitude. This will impact the performance of the machine learning algorithm and obviously, we do not want our algorithm to be biassed towards one feature.\n\nTherefore, we scale our data before employing a distance based algorithm so that all the features contribute equally to the result.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*MZKG8sTIdSNv6TXB\" width=50%>\n\n\n## 2. Tree-Based Algorithms : \n\nTree-based algorithms, on the other hand, are fairly insensitive to the scale of the features. Think about it, a decision tree is only splitting a node based on a single feature. The decision tree splits a node on a feature that increases the homogeneity of the node. This split on a feature is not influenced by other features.\n\nSo, there is virtually no effect of the remaining features on the split. This is what makes them invariant to the scale of the features!\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/925/0*U0rcW7XrdHpvI0hU.jpeg\" width=70%>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is Normalization?\n\nNormalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1.

Let me elaborate on the answer in this section.\n\n- Normalization is good to use when you know that the distribution of your data does not follow a Gaussian distribution. This can be useful in algorithms that do not assume any distribution of the data like K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks.\n\n- Standardization, on the other hand, can be helpful in cases where the data follows a Gaussian distribution. However, this does not have to be necessarily true. Also, unlike normalization, standardization does not have a bounding range. So, even if you have outliers in your data, they will not be affected by standardization.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, the choice of using normalization or standardization will depend on your problem and the machine learning algorithm you are using. There is no hard and fast rule to tell you when to normalize or standardize your data.

Handling Categorical Variables\n\nCategorical variables/features are any feature type can be classified into two major types:\n- Nominal\n- Ordinal\n\nNominal variables are variables that have two or more categories which do not have any kind of order associated with them. For example, if gender is classified into two groups, i.e. male and female, it can be considered as a nominal variable.Ordinal variables, on the other hand, have “levels” or categories with a particular order associated with them. For example, an ordinal categorical variable can be a feature with three different levels: low, medium and high. Order is important.\n\nIt is a binary classification problem:\nthe target here is **not skewed** but we use the best metric for this binary classification problem which would be Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). We can use precision and recall too, but AUC combines these two metrics. Thus, we will be using AUC to evaluate the model that we build on this dataset.\n\nWe have to know that computers do not understand text data and thus, we need to convert these categories to numbers. A simple way of doing that can be to use :\n- Label Encoding\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n```\n- One Hot Encoding\n```python\npd.get_dummies()\n```\n\nbut we need to understand where to use which type of label encoding:\n\n**For not Tree based Machine Learning Algorithms the best way to go will be to use One-Hot Encoding**\n- One-Hot-Encoding has the advantage that the result is binary rather than ordinal and that everything sits in an orthogonal vector space. \n- The disadvantage is that for high cardinality, the feature space can really blow up quickly and you start fighting with the curse of dimensionality. In these cases, I typically employ one-hot-encoding followed by PCA for dimensionality reduction. I find that the judicious combination of one-hot plus PCA can seldom be beat by other encoding schemes. PCA finds the linear overlap, so will naturally tend to group similar features into the same feature\n\n**For Tree based Machine Learning Algorithms the best way to go is with Label Encoding**\n\n- LabelEncoder can turn [dog,cat,dog,mouse,cat] into [1,2,1,3,2], but then the imposed ordinality means that the average of dog and mouse is cat. Still there are algorithms like decision trees and random forests that can work with categorical variables just fine and LabelEncoder can be used to store values using less disk space.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df[string_col].head()\nfor col in string_col:\n    print(f\"The distribution of categorical valeus in the {col} is : \")\n    print(df[col].value_counts())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.365611Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.365873Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.383826Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.365842Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.382727Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# As we will be using both types of approches for demonstration lets do First Label Ecoding \n# which will be used with Tree Based Algorthms\ndf_tree = df.apply(LabelEncoder().fit_transform)\ndf_tree.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.385395Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.386051Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.405358Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.386005Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-13T06:25:13.404467Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can use this directly in many tree-based models:\n- Decision trees\n- Random forest\n- Extra Trees\n- Or any kind of boosted trees model\n    - XGBoost\n    - GBM\n    - LightGBM\n    \nThis type of encoding cannot be used in linear models, support vector machines or neural networks as they expect data to be normalized (or standardized).

The reason for this wonderful effect is that the trees protect each other from their individual errors (as long as they don’t constantly all err in the same direction).
